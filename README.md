# Towards Quantifying the Hessian Structure of Neural Networks
This repository contains PyTorch implementations of Hessian visualization of neural networks. 

## How to use 

Install torch (>=1.8.0) and run the following command for the results on CIFAR-100.

```
python train_cifar.py
```

Run the following command for the results on Gaussian synthetic data.

```
python train_gaussian.py
```





```

```
